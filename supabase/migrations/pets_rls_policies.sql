-- STEP 2: Service Role Policy (Admin/Backend Access)
-- ============================================================
-- This policy allows the service role to bypass RLS completely

-- STEP 3: Authenticated User Policies (User Ownership-based)
-- ============================================================

-- POLICY SUMMARY
-- ============================================================

/*
üìã RLS POLICY STRUCTURE:

1. SERVICE ROLE (service_role)
   - Full access to all pets (bypasses RLS)
   - Used for backend operations

2. PET OWNERS (authenticated)
   - Can SELECT their own pets (matched by user_platform_id)
   - Can INSERT pets for themselves
   - Can UPDATE their own pets
   - Can DELETE their own pets
   - Ownership determined by profiles.platform_id = pets.user_platform_id

3. PLATFORM ADMINS (authenticated with admin role)
   - Can SELECT all pets across all users
   - Can INSERT pets for any user
   - Can UPDATE any pet
   - Can DELETE any pet
   - Admin role: 'platform_admin' or 'super_admin'

üîí SECURITY FEATURES:
- User-based ownership isolation via user_platform_id
- Role-based access control for admins
- Prevents users from accessing other users' pets
- Service role for backend operations
- Authenticated users only (no anonymous access)

‚öôÔ∏è REQUIREMENTS:
- public.profiles table with user_platform_id column
- public.pets table with user_platform_id column
- public.user_to_role_assignment table
- public.platform_roles table with role_name column
- Supabase auth.uid() function

üêæ PET OWNERSHIP MODEL:
- Pets belong to users (not organizations)
- pets.user_platform_id = profiles.user_platform_id (direct match)
- Users can only manage their own pets
- Admins can manage all pets

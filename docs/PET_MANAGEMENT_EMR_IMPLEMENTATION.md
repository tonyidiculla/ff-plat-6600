## Source Reference

These pages were inspired by and adapted from:

- **Source Project**: `organization-and-entities` repository
- **Source File**: `/src/features/clinical/emr/pages/EMR.tsx`
- **Adaptations Made**:
  1. Converted from React Router to Next.js App Router
  2. Updated import paths for components
  3. Added mock data for demonstration
  4. Enhanced with platform-specific styling
  5. Added StandardizedHeader from admin portal
  6. Integrated with admin portal color schemes
  7. Added additional features (species filter, vaccination tracking, medical alerts)

---

## Integration with Dashboard

Both pages are now accessible from the Platform Dashboard through the new cards:

1. **Pet Management Card**

   - Icon: Heart
   - Route: `/pets`
   - Stats: 12.5K Pets

2. **Pet EMR Card**
   - Icon: ClipboardList
   - Route: `/pet-emr`
   - Stats: 8.2K Active Records

---

## Mock Data

Both pages currently use mock data for demonstration. To integrate with Supabase:

### Required Tables:

1. `pets` or `patients` table with columns:

   - id, name, species, breed, age, weight, color
   - owner_id (foreign key to profiles)
   - organization_id (foreign key to organizations)
   - status, created_at, last_visit

2. `medical_records` table with columns:

   - id, pet_id, diagnosis, treatment, visit_date
   - veterinarian_id, organization_id
   - vaccinations, medical_alerts

3. `patient_onboarding` table (from EMR source):
   - id, pet_id, is_active, consent_verified
   - onboarded_at, created_at

### Next Steps for Database Integration:

1. Create appropriate Supabase tables
2. Replace mock data with useQuery hooks
3. Add CRUD operations for pet management
4. Implement EMR record creation and updates
5. Add real-time subscription for live updates
